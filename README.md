# My Resume Site

This is my personal resume site that can be accessed via https://anaclmartins-data.github.io/resume/. 

The purpose of this site is to showcase how my data skills can contribute to a business, as well as my experience in data science and data analytics.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a web developer, so there may be areas where improvements can be made. However, I've done my best to follow best practices and create a site that is easy to navigate and provides all the necessary information.
